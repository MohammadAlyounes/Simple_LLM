# Simple_LLM
## Level: Hard

A step-by-step with detailed implementation of a large language model (__STILL IN DEVELOPMENT__).

## Purpose of the project:
Mainly the purpose is to 'fully understand' (not 100% true in a deep learning context) how to code a large language model with the most necessary steps. For me and others; it always improved to better simplicity and illustration. It's like a ChatGPT but trained in small dataset to be run as locally as possible. I added comments to more explainability and __it needs to have a basic understanding of deep learning development__.
